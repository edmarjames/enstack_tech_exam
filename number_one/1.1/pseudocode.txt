FLOW

1. Initialize an empty list A.
2. Populate A with all possible tuples (x, y) where:
   - x ranges from 0 to 13
   - y ranges from 0 to 3
3. Sort A by (y, x) in ascending order.
4. Use a random shuffle algorithm to reorder A.
5. Output the shuffled list A.


IMPLEMENTATION

FUNCTION shuffle_list():
    A = EMPTY LIST
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 13:
        FOR y FROM 0 TO 3:
            APPEND (x, y) TO A

    SORT A BY (y, x) IN ASCENDING ORDER

    SHUFFLE A RANDOMLY USING A RANDOM SHUFFLING ALGORITHM

    RETURN A
